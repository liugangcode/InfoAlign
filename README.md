# Learning Molecular Representation in a Cell

**InfoAlign** learns molecular representations from bottleneck information derived from molecular structures, cell morphology, and gene expressions. For more details, please refer to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12056v3).

## Update on March 6, 2025:
- Added `convert_to_dataset.py`, which can be used to convert CSV files into a dataset for fine-tuning. For example:

  ```bash
  python convert_to_dataset.py --task_name chembl2k_sub --csv_path raw_data/chembl2k/raw/assays.csv.gz --smiles_column smiles --property_columns ABCB1 ABL1
## Update on Oct 14, 2024:
- All packages can now be installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`!
- We have **automated** the model and data download process for ML developers. The InfoAlign model can now be trained with a single command!
- We have created the `infoalign` package, which can be installed via `pip install infoalign`. For more details, refer to: [https://github.com/liugangcode/infoalign-package](https://github.com/liugangcode/infoalign-package).

## Requirements

This project was developed and tested with the following versions:

- **Python**: 3.11.7
- **PyTorch**: 2.2.0+cu118
- **Torch Geometric**: 2.6.1

All dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Create a Conda Environment**:
    ```bash
    conda create --name infoalign python=3.11.7
    ```

2. **Activate the Environment**:
    ```bash
    conda activate infoalign
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Fine-tuning

We provide a pretrained checkpoint available for download from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/liuganghuggingface/InfoAlign-Pretrained). For fine-tuning and inference, use the following commands. The pretrained model will be automatically downloaded to the `ckpt/pretrain.pt` file by default.

```bash
python main.py --model-path ckpt/pretrain.pt --dataset finetune-chembl2k
python main.py --model-path ckpt/pretrain.pt --dataset finetune-broad6k
python main.py --model-path ckpt/pretrain.pt --dataset finetune-biogenadme
python main.py --model-path ckpt/pretrain.pt --dataset finetune-moltoxcast
```

Alternatively, you can manually download the model weights and place the `pretrain.pt` file under the `ckpt` folder along with its corresponding YAML configuration file.

**Note**: If you wish to access the cell morphology and gene expression features in the ChEMBL2k and Broad6K datasets for baseline evaluation, visit our [Hugging Face repository](https://huggingface.co/liuganghuggingface/InfoAlign-Pretrained) to download these features.

### Pretraining

To pretrain the model from scratch, execute the following command:

```bash
python main.py --model-path "ckpt/pretrain.pt" --lr 1e-4 --wdecay 1e-8 --batch-size 3072
```

This will automatically download the pretraining dataset from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/liuganghuggingface/InfoAlign-Data). If you prefer to download the dataset manually, place all pretraining data files in the `raw_data/pretrain/raw` folder.

The pretrained model will be saved in the `ckpt` folder as `pretrain.pt`.
